!Add Analytics Model for the data, using raw sql
Add Analytics:
    !User-Agent: As you mentioned, capturing the User-Agent header can help you identify the user's browser, operating system, and device.
    !Client IP Address: Storing the IP address of the client can help you track the geographical location of your users.
    !Response Time: Measure the time it takes for your API to respond to requests. This can help identify performance bottlenecks.
    !Query Parameters: If applicable, log any query parameters sent with the request. This can provide insights into how users are using your API.
    !User ID or Session ID: If your API requires authentication, you can associate requests with specific users or sessions for user-specific analytics.
    !Timestamp of Request: Record the timestamp when each request is received to analyze usage patterns over time.
